# Kube-lab-installer

This project allows you to deploy a kubernetes cluster locally on your laptop. I made it to train for the CKA certification.
The following tools are required:

- Ansible 
- Vagrant with virtualbox
- kubeadm

## Setting

You can change the number of master or worker nodes in the cluster by changing the `master_count` `worker_count` variables in the `Vagrantfile`.   
You can change some parameters like container runtime or Kubernetes version in `ansible/group_vars/all.yml`.
The Ansible inventory is dynamically generated by Vagrant.  

## Install

```
$ ./start.sh
```
